# Virtual-Lab-Study-On-Residence-Time-Distribution-In-Plug-Flow-Reactor

- The project aims to create a virtual lab to study the residence time distribution in a plug flow 
  reactor. The residence-time distribution (RTD) of a reactor is a characteristic of the mixing
  that occurs in the chemical reactor.
- The virtual lab created by using Tkinter module in python is an independent desktop application 
  like other desktop applications and can be used on any windows platform.
- This virtual lab will hence provide the user with conductivity and time dataset for the chosen 
  time period to analyse the residence time distribution in a plug flow reactor.
